Q: Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the book, describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.

Answer:  Another embedded example could be a printer.  It has an RTOS to handle the critical real timing such as the printer head and printing operations.  Sensors on the printer for the mechanical systems must also rely on the RTOS to deliver critical timing information. 

Printers typically are low cost and so memory and speed constraints are challenges to the product.  Printers offer wireless technologies and must be secure from potential hackers.  And must be upgradeable to the latest and most secure versions of firmware.
